## Project Background
Xeeva's [Imperfect] Data Management team has tweaked the performance of its Vector Space Model to 85+% in controlled experiments. To enable  the model to function in a stand-alone mode in production, there is a need to reliably estimate whether the model's outputs can be relied on or not, or to create a *Confidence EStimator*.  This learned estimtator will guide Xeeva teams to either auto-classify a given record or not.

The goal of this analysis is to arrive at a best performing estimator that reliably estimates Vector Space Mode's classification performance in real-life.



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
